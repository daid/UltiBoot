UltiBoot
========

Replacement bootloader for the ArduinoMega2560 in an Ultimaker.

Features:
* Stk500v2 protocol (Arduino bootloader compatible)
* UltiController LCD messages
* SD card firmware upgrade (TODO)
* Check if the hardware watchdog has triggered and show a warning if it did. (TODO)

NOTE:
	This is work in progress. The SD card upgrade does not work yet. And the Makefile is missing.
